## Exo:
*   Given an array of integers, write a function to determine whether the array could become non-decreasing by modifying at most 1 element.
*   Example 1:
*    Input: [4,2,3]
*   Output: True
*  Explanation: You could modify the first 4 to 1 to get a non-decreasing array.
*  Example 2:
*  Input: [4,2,1]
* Output: False
* Explanation: You can't get a non-decreasing array by modifying at most one element.
